Problem 1:
Implement the dynamic programming algorithm described in class for solving the 0-1 Knapsack
problem and show that it works correctly. You have to implement the table as described in
lectures. You are required to also implement backtracking to make sure you list the set of items
chosen and not just the final value.

Problem 2:
a) Code the greedy algorithm you propose in Q2 a and b of the written part and show that is
works for the set of inputs described in parts a and b. (Consider the problem of making change for n cents using the fewest number of coins. Assume
that each coin’s value is an integer.
	a. Describe a greedy algorithm to make change consisting of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. 
	   Prove that your algorithm yields an optimal solution.
	b. Suppose that the available coins are in the denominations that are powers of c, i.e., 
	   the denominations are c0, c1, …, ck for some integers c > 1 and k = 1. Show that the greedy algorithm always yields an optimal solution.)

b) Code the algorithm you propose in Q2 d of the written part and show that it works for any set
of k different coin denominations, assuming that one of the coins is a penny. (Give an O(nk) time algorithm that makes change for any set of k different coin denominations, assuming that one of the coins is a penny.)
