** - Data.txt - contains sample data from the question. This or modified version of data can be directly used as input to the programs.


1. Selection Sort 
- It takes input array--> number of elements and then the elements of the array. A menu is presented after providing the input array. 
- Choice 1 - Sorts all the elements using selectionSort() function.
- Choice 2 - Asks for a value k and outputs k smallest elements of the input array.
- Choice 3 - Gives the media value of the input array.
- Choice 4 - EXITs
- To RUN
$gcc -o SelectionSort SelectionSort.c
$./SelectionSort


2. Cool Sort
- It takes input array --> number of elements and then the elements of the input array.
- It takes input H --> number of elements and then the elements of H.
- Displays the sorting steps for each H value as given in the demo example question.
- To RUN
$gcc -o CoolSort CoolSort.c
$./CoolSort

3. iFind
- The input array is treated as A[1...N] hence A[1] has index =1 and not 0 (as given in the question).
- Hence A = [-1	-2	3	5	6	7] has A[3] = 3
- The output when it finds "i" is - showing the index where this occurs first.
- To RUN
$gcc -o iFind iFind.c
$./iFind
