she was a           mangy pitiful animal It cost a lot to            adopt her forty dollars And then I had to buy litter a
litterbox food and dishes for her to             eat out of Two days after she came



home with me she got taken to
the pound by the animal warden Thers a leash law for cats in Fort Collins


If theyre not in your yard they have
to be on a leash Anyway            my cat is my best friend Im glad I got her She sleeps under the covers with me when its cold



Sometimes she meows a lot in




the middle of the night and wakes me up though
