Problem 1: (25 points)
Consider a graph of V vertices and E edges. One standard way to input a graph is to use an
adjacency matrix. The matrix is of size V*V. The value of the (i,j)th entry (i.e., ith row and jth
column) denotes the edge weight between vertices i and j. If two vertices have no edges between
them, then assign the edge weight to a large number. For this assignment, your program should
be able to print out a table (exactly similar to the one taught in class) demonstrating the running
of Dijkstra’s algorithm. The program should be able to take as input (i.e., source) any vertex in
the graph and then output the above table. 


Problem 2: (25 points)
In this problem, you will implement the Prim’s algorithm taught in class. No other
implementations will be accepted.
